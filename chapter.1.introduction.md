# Introduction into coding

> Code is everywhere.

## See

A very simple example of code is when you shop for groceries. Once you pay with your bank card a piece of software is running that allows you to enter a PIN code of a fixed length. After pressing OK it's also code that verifies your PIN and allows the transaction.

Website code is different from the above example. Instead of the code running on the hardware itself, it is used in browsers, like google chrome or internet explorer.

Great examples of code on the internet are google.com (*doh*), facebook.com and twitter.com. All these websites require thousands lines of code to support their functionality as we see it today.

## Identify

Code exists in multiple categories. The PIN machine example is in fact machine code, as it runs on the PIN appliance. Another version, the one we will be looking into, is a [programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), which is the driving force behind many web applications. It's never really visible to the visitor, being the motor in the car - more on this later on.

Next to our programming language we see a [Markup Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language). Two well known markup languages are HTML and XML. These languages are like an unified agreement on how to format output. Web browsers expect a markup language to be outputted to them; being HTML the one that is most common.

When comparing programming languages to markup languages the difference lies in what they do. Programming languages do not show output in a certain format, normally when programming languages output anything it's for debug purposes. Markup langauges on the other hand only show output in a certain way, they do not change the output by itself.
